N	analysis	of	If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ? 
N	form	of	In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .
