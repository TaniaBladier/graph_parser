Code from Tom McCoy at JHU.
This folder contains code for evaluating accuracy at resolving PP attachment.
It is based on the PP attachment dataset from Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos
(1994).

The files contained here are:
	d6.treeproperties: Contains info about the tree structure of each
		supertag in the MICA database
	test_set.txt: Each line corresponds to one test sentence. Each line
		has 4 tab-separated items, which are: (i) The correct assignment 
		of N or V describing the PP attachment, (ii) the noun that appears
		directly before the ambiguous PP, (iii) the preposition that
		begins the ambiguous PP, and (iv) the full test sentence.
	test_tags.txt: Each line i contains the supertags given to the
		sentence at line i of test_set.txt. To evaluate a different 
		supertagger, you would need to re-tag the sentences 
		from test_set.txt.
	pp_attachment_evaluator.py: The evaluation program. Run with: 
		python pp_attachment_evaluator.py
