When he returns home , he ties on an apron and begins to prepare dinner for his family .
Earlier this year , officials shipped in fresh crabs from Guangdong province .
It turned out that few workers here in the hills of Sichuan had ever seen them , so the factory TV station ran a broadcast on the correct way to eat Guangdong crabs .
The Li family home is a simple , two-room apartment with bare concrete floors and whitewashed walls .
Mr. Li 's wife , Xia Huaqiong , also works at the factory , tending the water meters during the graveyard shift .
There are few prospects for upward mobility , and Mr. Li 's daughter , seven-year-old Li Shu , is certain to toil at the factory too someday , as are more than 10,000 of the workers ' children .
Most evenings after the news , he leaves his wife in front of the TV set and wanders restlessly around his quiet neighborhood .
The center , built and run by Panzhihua Iron & Steel , is the beginning and end of social life in this town .
Mr. Li walks upstairs to the center 's second-floor library , a poorly lit room where he spends many hours leafing through a thin selection of state-controlled periodicals .
Today 's lead story : `` Manager Zhao Inspects Operation of No. 4 Furnace . ''
The band starts in , and she begins to sing `` Happy birthday to you , '' even though it is n't anyone 's birthday .
`` But I was happy to be here , to carry on the fight against the imperialists and the revisionists .
When the opportunity finally arose , thousands of workers departed , including virtually all of the factory 's college graduates and senior engineers .
He is pushing his child to excel in school and teaches him English at home .
Workers have a very sketchy knowledge , for example , about the pro-democracy movement , and its bloody suppression , in Beijing this spring .

`` The Chinese and American people have great warmth for each other , '' Mr. Li says , `` but I must tell you frankly that I disagree with President Bush 's policy toward China . ''
`` Well , I certainly did n't know any of that , '' Mr. Li says , and abruptly closes the conversation .

National Westminster Bank PLC , Yorkshire Bank 's biggest holder with a 40 % stake , said it , Barclays PLC , Lloyds Bank PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC decided to sell the 250-branch U.K. bank after receiving `` a number of approaches '' from potential purchasers .
At a news conference here yesterday , NatWest officials said they expect potential interest from banks throughout continental Europe , Australia and the U.S .
It is viewed by market analysts as a potential target for banks aiming to boost their U.K. presence prior to the 1992 development of a single market in financial services in the European Community .
Analysts have said the bank could fetch a price of between 8.5 and 10 times pretax profit -- or between # 850 million and # 1 billion .
The Federal Reserve gave comfort to the financial markets yesterday by allowing a key interest rate to drift downward .
That was a sign to financial markets that , at least for now , the Fed was easing its grip on credit .

`` I view this morning 's action as hand holding for the financial markets , '' said Steven Wood , an economist with Bank of America .
He said the Fed showed it was willing to provide more money to the financial system , but it was n't clear `` how much or for how long . ''
Mr. Greenspan appeared in public briefly yesterday morning to deliver a speech to the American Bankers Association convention here .
In a brief comment before the speech , he said he was `` surprised '' that some people interpreted his recent comments in Moscow `` as endeavoring to say something about current monetary or foreign exchange policies .
`` I hope my colleagues at the Gosbank { the Soviet central bank } do n't misinterpret anything I said today , '' the Fed chairman joked before beginning the prepared text of his speech .
He said the Fed was coordinating its activities with foreign officials , and that `` coordination exists at a detailed level here in the U.S. among the Federal Reserve , the SEC , the CFTC and the Treasury . ''
The Fed 's move to ease credit was n't an aggressive one , but it did signal a clear change of policy from before the stock market 's swoon .
If problems quickly disappear , the Fed may nudge the rate up to 8 3\ .
Bush administration officials were pleased with the Fed 's action , and shared Mr. Greenspan 's view that there was close coordination among the various government agencies .
That led administration officials to predict , accurately , that on Monday the market would have to drop 60 to 100 points before any recovery could begin .

Separately , David Ruder , who left the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission two weeks ago , says investors should view market volatility as a fact of modern market life .
`` I do not regard the amount of the decline on Friday as unexpected or unlikely , '' he said in a telephone interview .
`` With the market being up to 2,700 or 2,800 and the existence of derivative products ... one can expect volatility of the magnitude we had . ''
Mr. Ruder , now a professor at the Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago , also expressed concern about two pauses in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures pits after prices had fallen and circuit breakers kicked in .

Attempts in late September to drive the dollar down through central bank interventions were ill-timed , particularly since we now know that the dollar was then in the process of taking another dive relative to oil and other producer goods .
The Hamilton bill would put the Treasury Secretary on the Fed 's board and Open Market Committee , which charts monetary policy .
More worrisome , Congress would have a stronger supervisory role , with the Fed audited by the General Accounting Office , which Congress runs .
Both the Treasury and Congress traditionally have pushed for easy money , the Treasury to reduce its debt management problems and Congress to satisfy powerful producer constituencies who want a weak dollar for short-term competitive gains in world markets .
Even now , the Fed can not simply thumb its nose at the President and Congress .
Paul Volcker found subtle ways to take his case to the people , with good results .
It may do that temporarily but it also sows the seeds for stagnation .
Richard Nixon exacerbated the problem when , in response to pressures from Congress , he applied price and wage controls in August 1971 , thereby discouraging production .

In a terse news release responding to an article yesterday in The Wall Street Journal , which credited a front-page interview story in the Sunday Los Angeles Daily News , Valhi Inc. said the quotes in the articles `` do not accurately reflect Valhi 's and Mr. Simmons 's intentions '' concerning their interests in Lockheed .
Through Valhi and its affiliates , Mr. Simmons holds a 10.43 % stake in the aerospace and electronics concern , and his plans concerning Lockheed have been the subject of much speculation among securities analysts .

There were also rumors that the Japanese financial authorities warned large brokerage firms and institutional investors over the weekend against taking any hasty actions Monday .
As Japanese investors prepare for some rough waters this week , they will be paying close attention to the foreign exchange markets .
If the yen rebounds against the dollar , he said , there is less chance of an additional increase in interest rates , which could help stabilize Tokyo share prices .
Last Wednesday , the Bank of Japan raised the discount rate 0.5 percentage point to 3.75 % to stem the dollar 's rise .
Many Japanese funds , which closed their books at the end of September , now have huge cash positions .
`` There 's still lots of idle money sitting around here , '' said Hiroshi Ohira , chief analyst at New Japan Securities Co. , citing a frequently stated reason for Tokyo 's strength .
A severe drop in Japanese stock prices or a steep fall in the dollar would exacerbate price declines in smaller markets such as Hong Kong , money managers say .
Investors have already been treating the market with some caution .

Many London traders planned an allnight vigil on developments in the Tokyo market .
`` A lot of our guys will be sitting up all night at home , and a couple of our guys will be in the office overnight , '' said Mr. Wheat of Bankers Trust .
However , in an unusual public statement , the bank sought to play down any note of crisis .
Said a spokesman : `` There 's no reason for such an exaggerated fall in London , where share values are n't underpinned in the same degree as New York by highly leveraged situations . ''
Even before Friday 's New York nosedive , the London market had been facing heavy uncertainty because of worries over the British economy .
But a rate cut could weaken the recently depressed pound , which late Friday staged a sharp rally against the dollar after news of the New York market sell-off .

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Lockheed slipped $ 1 in Friday 's market slump to close at $ 48 a share .
Michael Lamb , who closely tracks Mr. Simmons 's holdings for a Kansas City , Mo. , firm called Wealth Monitors , said he is skeptical about the stated intention to sell off Lockheed shares .
He added that while one Simmons holding company , Valhi Inc. , has sold 272,000 Lockheed shares in recent months , his other companies have bought up 880,000 .
Yesterday 's announcement of the accord culminated a two-month long battle for the Tampa , Fla. , maker of bottles and other glass containers .
Anchor had been fighting Vitro 's earlier $ 20-a-share tender offer and agreed to the sweetened bid after a special committee of Anchor 's board put the company on the block .
Anchor said previously that it held talks with other parties , but no other bids emerged .
Vitro , which already owns 1,430,000 Anchor shares , agreed to buy the remaining 12,470,000 shares outstanding through THR Corp. , an indirect subsidiary of Vitro .
Vitro said Security Pacific National Bank committed $ 139 million to finance the purchase of Anchor and an affiliate of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. committed $ 155 million in a bridge loan to finance the Anchor and Latchford acquisitions .
Mr. Martens called the takeover a `` unique strategic opportunity '' for Vitro to become `` a world player '' in the glass-container industry .
But what was most terrifying was its speed : The market dropped 154 points in only 65 minutes , pausing only as the close neared .
But despite its hair-trigger edginess , whether the market today will in fact mirror 1987 with a further dive is a far different matter .
The reasons include the obvious differences in the market between this fall and 1987 : Interest rates have n't been rising this time , as they were in 1987 ; the dollar , though hit Friday , has n't been eroding dangerously ; the economy is n't overheating ; and , above all , stocks are far from being as wildly overpriced : They are selling at only about 13 times per-share earnings , compared with about 20 two years ago .
Many traders think the Fed will quickly lower interest rates , a move that would be a plus for stocks .
That market shut down early on Friday , leaving millions of dollars of sell orders unexecuted .

-- The pressures on mutual-fund companies to sell stock in order to meet demands from customers for redemptions .
On Black Monday , some funds sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stocks after being inundated with redemptions .
Any move to lower interest rates , for example , would be a positive for stocks , by making fixed-income investments less competitive with them .
Much as in the 1987 crash , the spark that lit the fuse on Friday was a news announcement that , at first blush , seemed to have little bearing on the market as a whole .
When the UAL buy-out group said it could n't get bank financing for its $ 6.79 billion deal , the announcement sent takeover-stock traders scrambling to sell United , other airline stocks and then other real or rumored takeover stocks .
The Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures took only 15 minutes from the UAL announcement , at 2:54 p.m. , to hit their first `` circuit breaker , '' a 30-minute trading halt that kicks in when the futures drop the equivalent of 100 points on the Dow .

There were also complaints that the specialists on the floor of the Big Board , who are charged with making markets in individual stocks , performed poorly during the plunge .
Trading was halted in 10 stocks when specialists could n't balance buy and sell orders in some stocks , such as entertainment giant Walt Disney Co .
One futures executive , Christopher Pedersen of Twenty-First Securities Corp. , says the specialists `` were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange .

So the `` arbs '' started dumping positions in their entire portfolios , including major blue-chip stocks that have had large price runups this year , in a desperate race for cash .
Paramount Communications Inc. , the subject of takeover whispers , plunged $ 6.625 a share to $ 56.625 .

Several big firms that do index arbitrage , in which traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures simultaneously to take advantage of price differentials , say they could n't execute trades because they could n't be sure of prices they would get on the stock exchange floor .
The speed of Friday 's drop is likely to reinforce the perception of many small investors that the markets are even more of a casino and have n't devised a manner for comfortably handling the awesome forces that technology has heaped upon them .
Despite two years of study , the marketplace remains one where ever-anxious large investors , haunted by memories of the 508-point plunge in 1987 and aided by powerful computers , can turn minor market upsets into major calamities in the space of a few hours .
In 1987 , then-Treasury Secretary James Baker was threatening a big drop in the dollar if West Germany raised interest rates .
This year , Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan seemed to warn he would n't lower interest rates merely to keep the dollar within an agreed-on exchange range .
In another similarity to 1987 , the government was threatening a crackdown on highly leveraged takeovers .
Then it was House Budget Committee Chairman Daniel Rostenkowski threatening to eliminate the tax deductibility of interest for certain debt-financed takeovers .
This year it was Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner voicing concern about airline buy-outs and threatening to force changes in the United deal .

But market observers point out that long-term government bond interest rates , currently at 7.85 % , are 2.5 percentage points lower than the level that prevailed in October 1987 , when interest rates had been rising for most of the year .
This year , the average ratio was 14 at the market peak one week ago , and finished Friday at 13 .

Takeover specialist Carl Icahn , whose 13.1 % stake in USX Corp. lost $ 151.2 million in value on Friday , says the stock market 's downturn may reflect the end of a speculative period that has generated many leveraged buy-outs that now face problems as a result of weakness in the junk-bond market .

Carl N. Singer was named chairman of this communications and electronics equipment supplier , succeeding Louis H. Wolcott , who resigned from the board .
But , it turns out , Wall Street -- quick to read tea leaves and quick to panic -- may have reached the wrong conclusion about the buy-out 's unraveling .
Banks did n't suddenly become unwilling to finance takeovers , they just did n't like the looks of this particular deal .
The airline 's top two officers , chief executive Stephen M. Wolf and chief financial officer John C. Pope , for example , would have made a total of more than $ 100 million on the buy-out through stock options they hold , even though their proposal called for them to put only $ 15 million of their own funds into the deal .

The banks also said they were worried that United 's rosy projections of future income -- and therefore its ability to pay off the debt -- did n't adequately take into account the bumpy nature of the airline industry .
From a lender 's point of view , `` it 's one of the worst big takeover proposals we 've seen , '' said an official of First Chicago Corp. , one of the banks asked to finance the buy-out , which notably did n't include junk bonds .
Even so , banks such as First Chicago , which has a long history of ties to UAL , stretched their lending guidelines as far as possible in hopes of making the proposal work .

Both the banks ' decision to decline financing and the stock market 's reaction caught the buy-out group off guard .
Gathered around a long table that filled the huge conference room were about 30 people , including representatives of Citicorp , Chase Manhattan , United Airlines , British Airways , Lazard Freres & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , Skadden Arps ( Mr. Wolf 's counsel ) and Paul Weiss ( lawyer for the pilots union ) .
One person who was n't present : Mr. Wolf himself who , confident that the deal would go through , was returning from Europe , where he had pitched the proposal to several big European banks .
Although they had provided the lion 's share of the financing on the Northwest Airlines buy-out just a few months before , Japanese banks had said no to UAL .
Machinists union leader John Peterpaul also made the union 's views known in telephone conversations with representatives of Mitsubishi Bank , one of the Japanese banks that was considering participating in the financing .
In those conversations , he reiterated the union 's position that it would seek significant wage increases in the round of contract talks set to begin next month .
As the Thursday afternoon deadline for banks neared , some lending officers at First Chicago remained in favor of joining the financing group , but the bank 's `` credit police '' were opposed , citing the high degree of risk associated with the loan .

Clearly , any new bid will have to include more profit for lenders and that probably means less cash for UAL shareholders , including the heavily stock-optioned Messrs. Wolf and Pope .

`` There were a lot of indications both before and after that this was a deal people thought well of . ''
The recent buy-out financing of NWA , Northwest Airlines ' parent , for instance , was a much more collaborative effort among several U.S. banks .
It was a far safer deal for lenders , since NWA had a healthier cash flow and more collateral on hand .

Fees paid to the banks , set at about 1.5 % of loans , are low compared with other buy-outs , which have paid 2 % to 2.5 % .
What 's more , fees in the UAL proposal were n't structured to encourage banks to commit to lending large amounts of money .
Lower interest rates usually diminish a currency 's appeal to international investors and speculators .

If foreigners dump U.S. stocks and return to the safety of their home markets -- as they did in October 1987 -- they must simultaneously also sell dollars for their own currencies .
Even if foreigners just withhold from buying additional U.S. securities , they reduce the demand for dollars .
Conversely , when foreigners buy American securities , they increase the demand for the U.S. currency .
A few hours later with the dollar trading at 1.8895 marks and 143 yen , the stock market began plunging , taking the U.S. currency with it .
`` The decline of the dollar was more a function of market makers dragging bids down than people massively selling , '' adds Richard Witten , vice president in charge of foreign-exchange operations at Goldman , Sachs & Co .
He added : `` Until Friday morning , market people were contending that further interest-rate hikes were necessary to keep the dollar bulls from running over { the central banks } ; there seemed to be a sense of the dollar bulls coming back and taking control again . ''
In the past week and a half , major European countries -- led by West Germany and Japan -- raised official domestic interest rates , mostly to keep their currencies from falling further and to stem the inflationary impact of those declines .
`` If nothing happens abroad and the Fed is forced to ease here to calm markets , the dollar is going to go down ; there would be a flight to quality as people start to worry about the U.S. financial system , '' says Michael D. Andrews , a vice president at Merrill Lynch & Co .
But if , as in October 1987 , they dump dollar-denominated securities and run to foreign markets , they will increase pressure on the dollar to fall .
`` Many of the banks in the U.S. called their counterparts in the Far East and Europe , '' says Chase Manhattan 's Mr. Kessler .
`` And dealers who had gone home in the Far East and Europe long dollars started selling when they were awakened during the night and told that the stock market was down , that Fed funds were at 8 3\ % and that the Fed might begin to ease , '' Mr. Kessler adds .
`` That may be a signal of a turning point in the strategies of international portfolio managers , '' he says .
Harris Trust 's Mr. Fio Rito predicts that `` an equity market hit will trigger further liquidation ; with the Japanese and Germans raising { interest } rates , the fundamentals changed for the dollar . ''
`` People began to question shifting { funds } for differences this small , '' he adds .
That , he says , `` should increase the demand for dollars '' by investors who want to buy real U.S. assets , such as real estate and companies .
Barring a catastrophe in the U.S. stock market , Mr. Kessler believes that the dollar in the near term should weaken further to about 1.8650-1.8850 marks and 142-143.50 yen .

Fossett Corp. , an options-trading firm , said last night that it is transferring all of its customer accounts to First Options of Chicago .
Stephen Fossett , president and sole owner of the company , said that he was making the transfers as a result of a substantial cash squeeze stemming from numerous calls for cash and margin money on Friday by several stock-option and futures exchanges .
Although few other trading firms here or in New York appeared to be in immediate financial difficulty , Friday 's volatility also underscored the need for exchanges in Chicago to hasten the common clearing of futures and options contracts , traders said .

When the Merc imposed its first halt in the S&P 500 futures contract after the 12-point drop , the stock index on which the contract is based went down from eight points to 13 points , roughly in line with the futures contract .
But conflicting steps by some Chicago exchanges caused consternation among traders .
Chicago Board Options Exchange officials , for instance , halted trading in their S&P 100-stock index option contract , as expected , shortly after the Merc imposed its initial trading halt .
The CBOE action also may have driven prices lower in the Chicago Merc 's huge S&P 500 index futures pit , traders said .
As much as 25 % of the volume in S&P 500 futures on most days comes from CBOE traders hedging their risks in the options markets .
With their own market closed late Friday , some options traders deluged the S&P 500 futures pit with sell orders to hedge their frozen options positions , traders said .
As a result , one of the largest options-trading firms in the country offered to sell 1,000 S&P 500 contracts at the limit of 30 index points below the previous day 's close , an S&P 500 futures trader said .
That offer and others like it killed any chance of a late rally and drove down stock-index futures prices to the daily limit , the trader added .

Liquidating the Irvine , Calif. , thrift will drain the federal deposit insurance fund by more than $ 2.5 billion , making it the largest thrift failure in history .
Charles Keating Jr. , the chairman of American Continental , Lincoln 's parent company , needed the Senators ' help in his running battle with federal regulators .
He admits he made large contributions to each of them so they would `` take up my cause .
In April 1987 , the Senators , , absent Mr. Riegle , asked to meet with Ed Gray , then head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , and according to Mr. Gray , unsuccessfully pressed him to drop a key regulation detrimental to Lincoln -- `` a clear subversion of the regulatory process .
-- Senator McCain recently reimbursed Mr. Keating for $ 13,400 in previously unreported airplane trips , and revealed that his wife and father-in-law invested $ 359,100 in a Keating shopping-center partnership in 1986 .
-- Senator Cranston solicited $ 850,000 in contributions from Mr. Keating for three `` nonpartisan '' voter-registration groups , which some former employees now say were fronts for the Democratic Party .
-- Senator Glenn solicited $ 200,000 in contributions from Mr. Keating for a political committee he controlled that paid him to travel around the country .
The S&L bailout promises to cost the taxpayers some $ 200 billion , with Lincoln accounting for $ 2.5 billion alone .
Similarly , the spate of dubious prosecutions in finance obscures the seriousness of the allegations against Mr. Keating and his associates .
Money was taken into Lincoln , for example by selling $ 250 million in uninsured debentures near retirement communities , and allegedly taken out of the parent company by insiders , for example by the sale of their personal stock to the company 's employee stock ownership plan .

The timing of Quantum 's chief executive officer , John Hoyt Stookey , appeared to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased Quantum 's reliance on plastics .
The stock , having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1 , closed at $ 34.375 share , down $ 1.125 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday .
The stock , having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1 , closed at $ 34.375 share , down $ 1.125 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday .
Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp. , the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's job in 1986 .
Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items .
That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs .
China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them .

Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation .
Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend , raised 36 % to 75 cents a share only a year ago , has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. Stookey deflected dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts .

On top of everything else , Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris , Ill .
This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum 's fortunes .
A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum 's financial future .
Quantum hopes the Morris plant , where limited production got under way last week , will resume full operation by year 's end .
The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity .
Quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals , propane marketing .
Petrolane is the second-largest propane distributor in the U.S .
The name surfacing in rumors is British Petroleum Co. , which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the U.S .
RJR Nabisco Inc. is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time , just a month after moving 11 of the group 's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta .
The spokesman said RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms , FCB\ Katz and McCann Erickson .
`` We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost , '' said the spokesman , who declined to specify how much RJR spends on network television time .
An executive close to the company said RJR is spending about $ 140 million on network television time this year , down from roughly $ 200 million last year .
The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago , when RJR 's previous management moved it to Atlanta , the company 's headquarters before this summer .
One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a future .

Brazil , similar to Mexico and South Korea , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas , which expired Sept. 30 .
Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990 .
In recent years , U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80 % of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation .
Of the remaining 20 % needed , the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15 % to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which is n't included in the quota program .
Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel .
The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until March 31 , 1992 .
The U.S. termed its plan , a `` trade liberalization program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension .

In the recent talks , the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons , to 7 % of the U.S. market from 6.7 % in 1988 .
Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1 % of the U.S. steel market to allocate .
These optional 1%-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration 's steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries .

The lower results , Mr. Pierce said , reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones , Elcotel 's primary business .
Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year , he said Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas .
Within the next year , Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines , made by Minolta in Japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , drugstores and other public settings around the country .
Mr. Pierce said Elcotel should realize a minimum of $ 10 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .
Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company 's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls .
Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone , Mr. Pierce said , not just phones produced by Elcotel .
The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones , which do n't accept coins , for use in hotel lobbies , office lobbies , hospitality lounges and similar settings .
Mr. Pierce estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ 5 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .

Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload .
The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds .
It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as Kao Corp. , may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S .
The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets .
She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others .
When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % .
While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders .
While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders .
The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it 's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , Tide with Bleach .
With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry .
With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry .
In the early 1980s , P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe .
P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .
Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S .
To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G , which has about 23 % of the market .
The EC steel industry , which has been coping with strong European demand , has been supplying about 5 % of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 % .

Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher .
But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action .
But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action .
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills .
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic .
Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher 's , Mrs. Hills replied : `` I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration .
`` I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement .
When she met the local press for the first time on Friday , Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and supercomputers , three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill .

At her news conference for Japanese reporters , one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief .
`` My impression was that you would be a scary old lady , '' he said , drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues .

Salomon Brothers International Ltd. , a British subsidiary of Salomon Inc. , announced it will issue warrants on shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd .
Under the latest offer , HK$ 62.5 million ( US$ 8 million ) of three-year warrants will be issued in London , each giving buyers the right to buy one Hong Kong Telecommunications share at a price to be determined Friday .
The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK$ 1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26 % .
While Hong Kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares , Salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party .
The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe , the bankers added , because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that has international appeal .

Ideal 's current operations will represent about 39.2 % of the combined company .
And they 're likely to stay that way for months to come , analysts say .
For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say .
Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months .
That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s .
Stocks were 698 million bushels on May 31 of this year .
The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels .

Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop .
However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 .

Through Valhi and its affiliates , Mr. Simmons holds a 10.43 % stake in the aerospace and electronics concern , and his plans concerning Lockheed have been the subject of much speculation among securities analysts .
But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks .
The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that `` if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which Saatchi knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders .
Mr. Spielvogel is n't part of the board , nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi 's big U.S.-based ad agencies .
That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 .

`` Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage , but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run , '' said Edward J. Atorino , industry analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
For instance , Gannett Co. posted an 11 % gain in net income , as total ad pages dropped at USA Today , but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates .
Gannett 's 83 daily and 35 non-daily newspapers reported a 3 % increase in advertising and circulation revenue .
Total advertising linage was `` modestly '' lower as classified-ad volume increased , while there was `` softer demand '' for retail and national ad linage , said John Curley , Gannett 's chief executive officer .
Revenue gained 6 % to $ 2.55 billion from $ 2.4 billion .
The year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ 3.5 million , or four cents a share .
The drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine .
A spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the yearearlier quarter 's figure , when Newport reported net income of $ 1.7 million , or 21 cents a share , on $ 14.1 million in sales .

After a supply crunch caused prices to rise 14 % since 1986 to $ 650 a metric ton , analysts are encouraged , because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year .
Companies with daily newspapers in the Northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad linage .
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability .
General Motors Corp. , in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity .
In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories .
In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories .
The company , currently using about 80 % of its North American vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 .
Now , GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s .
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match .
Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year .
GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin .
Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward union members .

GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves :
Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars .
GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said .
The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 .
Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand .

Institut Merieux S.A. of France said the Canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of Connaught BioSciences Inc. for 942 million Canadian dollars ( US$ 801.6 million ) .
Alan Nymark , executive vice president of Investment Canada , which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company .
He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed .
`` This is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used before , '' said Jodi Redmond , press secretary for Harvie Andre , Canada 's minister of industry , science and technology .
Mr. Mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out-of-court settlement of Connaught 's dispute with the University of Toronto .
The University is seeking to block the acquisition of Connaught by foreign interests , citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in Canada .
While neither side will disclose its contents , Mr. Mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in Canada than Merieux offered to Investment Canada .

The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden , a great zoo , its own charming Little Italy ( on Arthur Avenue ) and , of course , the Yankees .
In a lovely , novelistic memoir , `` Sleeping Arrangements '' ( Knopf , 195 pages , $ 18.95 ) , she remembers an exotic playground , peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic ( real oddballs like her sexpot friend , the hell-kitten Diana , age five ) .
Ms. Cunningham , a novelist and playwright , has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall .
She transforms her `` Bronx of the emotions , a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria '' into the `` Babylonian Bronx , '' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue .
For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl : `` ... outwardly ordinary , inwardly ornate , owing all inspiration to heathen cultures .

With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe , an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist ( who rhymed river with liver in a love song ) ; and Uncle Len , a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope , like an `` undercover President on a good-will mission .

Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said it agreed to pay $ 1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho .
Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said it agreed to pay $ 1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho .
In 1984 the EPA notified Gulf Resources , which was a part-owner of the smelter , that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal Superfund program .
Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern , potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter 's cleanup costs .

The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA , it `` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization .
'' The company , which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday , said that $ 1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ 500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement .
Gulf Resources added that it `` will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the Superfund law . ''

Under the agreement , Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock .
Separately , the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 to vote on its proposed reorganization .
Many of the nation 's highest-ranking executives saluted Friday 's market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players .
Assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall , some executives think Friday 's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating .
`` This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations , rather than to any fundamentals , '' said John Young , chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co. , whose shares dropped $ 3.125 to $ 48.125 .
`` People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs , do something about takeovers , do something about Donald Trump , '' said Rand Araskog , chairman of ITT Corp. , whose stock dropped $ 3.375 .

The executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes .

`` There has n't been any fundamental change in the economy , '' added John Smale , whose Procter & Gamble Co. took an $ 8.75 slide to close at $ 120.75 .
Of course , established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists .
Of the 19 economists who worked on the Business Council forecast , only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years , and in `` both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession , '' said Lewis Preston , chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co. and vice chairman of the Business Council .
The real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market .
`` There is an unbelievable amount of space available , '' says Faith Consolo , senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc .
There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 .
That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 .
The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing .
Weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail space vacant , exacerbates the problem for landlords .
It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt .
The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents .
But , despite the recent softening , for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s , when their leases were signed .
Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon .
The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $ 100 a square foot , as do up-and-coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue .

When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today , the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure .
For the first time , the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high court 's majority .
But are these four players , three of them in their 80s , ready to assume a different role after 88 years , collectively , of service on the high court ?
Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways .
The four justices are no newcomers to dissent , often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court 's conservative drift .

In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 , the height of the Warren Court 's power , Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court .
Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions , with the contentious flag-burning ruling as his only big victory .
But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech .

He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions .
`` We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , '' he said in a speech last month .
Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a `` generation-skipping '' flavor to current dissents .
Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues , especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion , Roe vs. Wade .
Justice Stevens , 69 , is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others .

Time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways .
In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 .

In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 .
However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher .
In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers .
Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies .
But Time , as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner , wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks .
Besides , Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky .
`` That perception takes the focus off the magazine . ''
Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers .
However , Time executives used the same explanation when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million .
It 's not a show of weakness ; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits . ''

That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news .
Its niche as the `` network of record '' during major crises draws elite audiences around the world .
So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network .
The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier , a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism .
It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers .
And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team .

Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research .
The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels .
It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look .
`` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says Paul Amos , CNN executive vice president for programming .
Accordingly , CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. Amos .
Until now , CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period .
She 's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly , in-depth segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories .
CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS .

That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces .
`` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job .
But to improve , they 've really got to make the investment in people . ''
In any case , cable-TV-system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with CNN 's format .
They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage .

Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application to buy five Valley Federal branches , leaving the transaction in limbo .
The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp. , whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements .
The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received .
The transaction , announced in August , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San Joaquin Valley .
Terms were n't disclosed , but Valley Federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million in operating costs annually .
Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp. , which said it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements .
In the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $ 33.1 million .
Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers , developers and creditors .
The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments .
Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , even the S&L lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position .
Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law .
`` If true , '' the court wrote , `` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds .
'' But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas .

But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group , the developer of Valley Ranch , dismisses such arguments as a `` defense du jour .
'' Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award , including the reversal of Sunbelt 's foreclosure on Valley Ranch .
`` We 're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory , '' he says .
`` We 'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize . ''

Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped .
That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .

All year , energy prices have skewed the producer price index , which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods .
While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 .
Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain .
`` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained .

CenTrust Savings Bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock , indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened .
The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health .
For the nine months ended June 30 , CenTrust had a net loss of $ 21.3 million , compared with year-earlier net income of $ 52.8 million .
CenTrust , which is Florida 's largest thrift , holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation .
Since April , it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $ 890 million from $ 1.35 billion .
The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings , but CenTrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market .
Mr. Atherton said CityFed will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds .

Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in July , long before now .
Many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal .
CenTrust , however , touts the branch sale , saying it would bring in $ 150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion .
It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ 82 million , or about 1.2 % of assets , from a negative $ 33 million as of Sept. 30 , thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards .
CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ 180 million .

British Aerospace PLC and France 's Thomson-CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided-missile divisions , greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors .
The 50-50 joint venture , which may be dubbed Eurodynamics , would have combined annual sales of at least # 1.4 billion ( $ 2.17 billion ) and would be among the world 's largest missile makers .
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting .

In recent months , a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture .
The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe 's defense industry .
Yesterday , a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight , as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF .
Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra , Britain 's Dowty Group PLC , West Germany 's Daimler-Benz AG , and France 's Dassault group .
GEC plans first to study Ferranti 's financial accounts , which auditors recently said included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit , International Signal & Control Group , with which Ferranti merged last year .
Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators ; Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry .
A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti : `` Competition is the name of the game , '' she said .
The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman said , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting .
Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans .
To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture , Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace .
British Aerospace 's chief missile products include its 17-year-old family of Rapier surface-to-air missiles .
`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc .
`` There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side , '' he said .
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada .
Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude .
Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East .
Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude , however , since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada 's falling output .
Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 .

In the second quarter , the steelmaker had net income of $ 45.3 million or $ 1.25 a share , including a pretax charge of $ 17 million related to the settlement of a suit , on sales of $ 1.11 billion .
The company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter , compared with the second quarter .
The company said it is beginning to see some shipping-rate improvements in both the intergrated-steel and steel-service-center segments , which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter .
In the year-ago quarter , the designer and operator of cogeneration and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $ 326,000 , or four cents a share , on revenue of about $ 41.4 million .
Predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately .
Investors -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing -- reacted by selling the company 's stock , which lost $ 3.25 that day to close at $ 52 in national over-the-counter trading .
Last week , Microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 to increase 34 % .
Microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms .
Apple Computer Inc. , meanwhile , is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended Sept .
PSE Inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $ 1.3 million to $ 1.7 million , or 14 cents to 18 cents a share .

The population of all four states is on the upswing , according to new Census Bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s .
Still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since 1981 .
Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including New York , which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s .

A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City .
Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` Duck Soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water .
Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` Duck Soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water .
Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company .
He said Jews were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . ''
If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ?
In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves .
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .
But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief .
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict .
That 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .
In `` Chicken Soup , '' Mr. Mason plays Jackie , a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie ( Lynn Redgrave ) , an Irish widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother ( Rita Karin ) and her brother Michael ( Brandon Maggart ) .
Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` Abie 's Irish Rose '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain .

Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear , to preach about social issues .
To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them .
For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .
For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .
I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz .
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America .

The Senate 's decision to approve a bare-bones deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year .
`` We 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill , '' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser ( D. , Tenn .
White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill .
`` We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains , '' he said .
The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year .
He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut .
But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill .
Also missing from the Senate bill is the House 's repeal of a law , called Section 89 , that compels companies to give rank-and-file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives .
To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken .
Sen. Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator .
In addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % excise tax on long-distance telephone calls .
It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees .
Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties , which would have raised $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 .
The measure repeals a 50 % exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP , if the ESOP owns less than 30 % of the employer 's stock .

That Mr. Lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the Fifth Amendment .
He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution .
Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth .
He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary .

Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ?
The problem , which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. Lantos , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary\ body .

I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings .
The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself .
'' This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify .
Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth .
'' The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only .
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .
Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination .

In the '70s , the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you-know-what .
Many traders think the Fed will quickly lower interest rates , a move that would be a plus for stocks .
Another study found that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices .
In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in Friday 's market activity .

Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur .
On days like Friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to .
Two years ago , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began dumping shares , exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices .
But , with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand .
Institutional investors , which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter , were calmer .
`` If they could n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf .
In addition , Mr. DaPuzzo said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index sent occasional `` waves `` through the market .

Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . ''
Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig was n't daunted when Friday 's rout shaved $ 40 million from the value of the $ 752 million Janus Fund he oversees .
Then he jumped into the market : `` I spent $ 30 million in the last half-hour . ''
`` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . ''
Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone .
The $ 56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System , for one , added $ 1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago .
`` Those that pulled out ( of stocks ) regretted it , '' he said , `` so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday 's decline .

The West German retailer ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands .
The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit ASKO plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management-controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders .

Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman Willard Butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican , but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush 's economic policy-making .
`` There are some very significant issues out there , such as the fiscal deficit , the trade deficit , our relations with Japan , that have to be the subject of major initiatives , '' he said in an interview .
Politicians tried to finger each other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street 's woes .
-- By 11:59 p.m. tonight , President Bush must order $ 16 billion of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law .
The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill .
`` One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , '' said Lawrence Kudlow , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
-- The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers .
The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period .
But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year .
Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented .
They learned they could survive it without much problem . ''
In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around .
`` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) .
`` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said yesterday on CBS News 's `` Face the Nation . ''
At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it .
When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it .
Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit .

`` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman ( R. , N.H .
The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion .
Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains .

Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash , `` but no one got discouraged , and we gained that back -- and more . ''
Some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the U.S. were attending when the market started to slide Friday .
In fact , some of the association 's members -- long-term , buy-and-hold investors -- welcomed the drop in prices .
`` We hope to take advantage of it , '' said John Snyder , a member of a Los Angeles investors ' club .
He has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants .
Not everyone is reacting so calmly , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday 's slide , reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines .
Marc Perkins , a Tampa , Fla. , investment banker , said the market drop is one of `` a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending .
There 's no question that there 's a general distaste for leverage among lenders .

Compaq 's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market .

Compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like Dynabook Inc. , which introduced in June a computer that , like Compaq 's , uses an Intel 286 microprocessor and has a hard disk drive .

Tandem Computers Inc. , preparing to fight with International Business Machines Corp. for a piece of the mainframe business , said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
The results , which are in line with analysts ' estimates , reflect `` a continued improvement in our U.S. business , '' said James Treybig , Tandem 's chief executive officer .
A spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the yearearlier quarter 's figure , when Newport reported net income of $ 1.7 million , or 21 cents a share , on $ 14.1 million in sales .
Tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week .

The stock market 's swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy .
It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar .
That has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable .
Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy .
The Fed , which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets .
Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies .
But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .
Anticipating the Fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625 % late Friday , down from 8.820 % the day before .
Tiny movements in the rate , which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets .
Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals , threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years .

Axa-Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion acquisition of Farmers Group Inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates .
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers .
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers .
In an attempt to appease U.S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers , Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T .
As part of the agreement , Axa agreed to invest $ 1 billion in Hoylake Investments Ltd. , Sir James 's acquisition vehicle .
In an interview Thursday , Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of Axa , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by Cie .
Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing .
Mr. Bebear said Axa-Midi Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition .
He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers .
`` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said .
Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated .
The new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one , and Axa still plans to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt .

Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year .
This appears particularly true at GM , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level .
Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up .
Furthermore , dealers contacted late last week said they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday 's steep market decline .
Lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month-end .
Last year , GM had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold .
Separately , Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models .

Hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight .
Television , which most of the time is considered rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , `` The End of the Day , '' which comes on after 11 p.m .
It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs .
The Budapest office plans to hire free-lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in Hungarian country towns from Nagykanizsa in the west to Nyiregyhaza in the east .
The Hungarian service has a daily 40-minute news show called Newsreel , with international and domestic news , plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world .
There 's also a host of new programs , trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics .

Proposals for government-operated `` national service , '' like influenza , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to mutate and afflict public life anew .
Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with smallpox .
If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving .
A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft .
Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many national-service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion .
Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ?
Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned , but require some form of service from each recipient ?
The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents .
In this case , the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid ( particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn ) , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation ( a la Sen. Chris Dodd ) , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects ( a Kennedy specialty ) , a community service work-study program for students ( pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers , among others ) , plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer , Foster Grandparent , and Senior Companion programs .

Let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning .
Those are not trivial questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them .
Ignore `` national service '' in the abstract ; consider specific proposals .
There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a GI Bill without the GI '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given .
But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs .

) But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior .
It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages .
Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing .
They involve stipends to participants .
But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves ( and others ) , to take control of their lives , to think of the future .
That is a service to the nation .

Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet .
And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge .
In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout .
`` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on anonymity .
The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning .
Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan .
It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October 1987 , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat .
The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions .

Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a statement Friday that the stock-market decline `` does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy . ''
But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week .
As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises .
He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers .
Government officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business-as-usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic .
That 's the advice of most investment professionals after Friday 's 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Indeed , some pros see Friday 's plunge , plus any further damage that might occur early this week , as a chance for bargain hunting .
`` There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , '' says Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc .

The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc .
Marc Perkins , a Tampa , Fla. , investment banker , said the market drop is one of `` a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending .
The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume .
A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash .
The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets .
Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges .
Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels .

There were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock-index futures and options , which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin , for example , likened to `` barnacles attached to the basic market .
'' And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers .
Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers .
The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .
Privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists .
-- If DJIA drops 400 points , Big Board halts trading for two hours .
-- Establish an overarching regulator for financial markets
-- Require prompt reports of large securities trades .

Seeking to keep Justin 's `` My Own '' product line off the U.S. market , Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law .
Since then , life has changed a lot for 61-year-old Leonard Kaye , Justin 's owner .
`` It 's the most distracting thing in my life -- I ca n't even attend to my business .
'' His company ( annual sales : about $ 25 million ) may suffer a costly blow -- losing an estimated 10 % of total sales -- if Sony ( annual sales : about $ 16 billion ) prevails .
Justin 's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational .
With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U.S. business .
Today , U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo is expected to rule on Sony 's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products , on which deliveries began in July .
The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments .
Justin has been profitable since 1986 , adds the official , who shares his office with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of plush toys .
Like many others , Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children .
Like many others , Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children .
Sony found a new market niche , but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor .
His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color .
Indeed , concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as withholding desirable Sony products -- against Justin 's customers , Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April .
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit .
Sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics -- including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer -- are routine in such matters .
( Justin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children 's market .

`` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor Martin D. Sass , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund .
Junk 's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash .
Simultaneously , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest-quality securities they could find .

For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece 's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass .
In the mid-June round of voting , Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party .
The ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates .
Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity .
Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched .
On another issue , Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency , the EYP , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and PASOK cabinet members .
So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense .

Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid , a Palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight .
The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case , but the matter awaits final approval from Greece 's next justice minister .
Also , he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March .
New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles .
But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck , it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated .

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws .
The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of Apple Computer Inc. , claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the Lisa computer , introduced in 1983 .
`` The court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company 's statements , '' said Patrick Grannon , a Los Angeles lawyer at the firm of Greenfield & Chimicles , which was n't involved in the case .

For third quarter last year , Keystone reported a $ 1 million loss from continuing operations and a $ 200,000 loss from discontinued operations , for a net loss of $ 1.2 million .
Mr. Simmons said the results signal a turnaround for the maker of wire and wire products , which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of lower-priced , imported steel .

Mr. Simmons said Keystone 's new mill is expected to produce about 585,000 tons of steel rods this year , up from 413,000 tons in 1988 .
Production at the mill has exceeded the ability of Keystone 's casting operation to supply it , he said , which will force Keystone to purchase billet , or unfinished steel bars , from outside the company during the fourth quarter and next year .
Keystone will have to consider expanding its casting operation , at an estimated cost of $ 8 million to $ 10 million , within the next 18 to 24 months , Mr. Simmons said .

And banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans .
Not everyone is reacting so calmly , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday 's slide , reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines .

Of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease .
To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms .
It must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective .

Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate $ 1 million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who interceded with thrift-industry regulators for him .
Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into insolvency .
Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause , the self-styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona , Alan Cranston of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question ... had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause .
The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. , successor to the Bank Board , filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on Sept. 15 .

In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign , Sen. Riegle , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , returned $ 76,000 in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators .
Mr. Keating , his family members and associates also donated $ 112,000 to Sen. McCain 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts .
But Sen. McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted .
`` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp , '' Sen. McCain recalls .
In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston , who conceded that soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing to do politically . ''

In addition , Sen. Cranston received $ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating , and the California Democratic party received $ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year .
Also in July , Ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn .
Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee .

When China opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979 , toy makers from Hong Kong were among the first to march in .
The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies .
`` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says David Yeh , chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd .
`` South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' says Henry Hu , executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd .
Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border .
In 1988 , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to HK$ 10.05 billion ( US$ 1.29 billion ) .
In 1988 , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to HK$ 10.05 billion ( US$ 1.29 billion ) .

In 1988 , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to HK$ 10.05 billion ( US$ 1.29 billion ) .
Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8 % in September to $ 32.82 billion .
The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results .
Still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games .
Paul Kwan , managing director of Playmates , says 10 million Ninja Turtles have been sold , placing the reptilian warriors among the 10 biggest-selling toys in the U.S .
Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season , which accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , Mr. Kwan said the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates .
Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 .
Besides the lack of a fast-selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System , an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan .
Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity .
The White House said minors have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents .
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr argued that the 1973 Supreme Court decision , Roe vs. Wade , recognizing a constitutional right to abortion , was incorrect .
The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion .
Under that standard , which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' justification for adopting it .
That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for restricting abortion .
Aluminum Co. of America , hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas , said net income for the third quarter dropped 3.2 % to $ 219 million , or $ 2.46 a share .
Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8 % in September to $ 32.82 billion .
Much of the earnings decline was led by currency-exchange rate adjustments , which affected the bottom line by $ 15.3 million , or 17 cents a share , compared with $ 3.6 million , or four cents a share , the previous year .
Excluding the higher tax rate , which rose two percentage points to 38 % , and the negative exchange rate adjustment , the company would have met analysts ' expectations , said R. Wayne Atwell , an analyst with Goldman , Sachs & Co .
Noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's slowest , Mr. Atwell added , `` the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway . ''
Nevertheless , the company said shipments were up slightly to 679,000 metric tons from 671,000 , buffing the impact of the unexpected earning decline .
NBC may yet find a way to take a passive , minority interest in a program-maker without violating the rules .
But the networks ' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios .
Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin-syn restraints .
Studios are `` powerless '' to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends .
Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess , urging the studios and the networks , which license rights to air shows made by the studios , to work out their own compromise .
But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication .
Various evidence , including a Brookings Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s , showed the networks did n't wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged .
In Congress , the issue falters : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue .
The suit named the company , former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr. , former vice president Robert W. Reedy and five defendants who were n't part of the company .
The company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension .
Elcotel , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ 272,000 , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30 .
The lower net included a charge of $ 35 million , equal to 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis , for the cost of abandoning a computer-systems joint venture with Siemens AG of West Germany .
For the nine-month period , Intel reported net of $ 268.3 million , or $ 1.43 a share , down 27 % from $ 367.1 million , or $ 2.05 a share .

But the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing .
There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night , when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years .
President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government .

Analysts expect installations of new telephone lines to grow about 3 % .
Nynex Corp. 's profits could begin to show signs of weakening from the effects of a nearly three-month strike , while other Bell companies , such as Ameritech and Southwestern Bell Corp. , could be hurt in the quarter by one-time charges associated with the settlement of new union contracts .
Rochester Telephone Co. , for instance , said it expects third-quarter earnings to be `` somewhat lower '' than the year-earlier quarter -- even though the company expects to post an extraordinary gain of 50 cents during the period .
For the 1988 third quarter , Rochester Telephone reported a net income of $ 12.9 million , or $ 1.10 a share , on revenue of $ 120.2 million .
As previously reported , Sony has agreed to pay $ 3.4 billion to acquire Columbia and separately has agreed to pay $ 200 million for Guber Peters Entertainment to obtain the services of its two co-chief executives .

In its suit , Warner says that Mr. Ross warned Sony 's Mr. Schulof on Sept. 26 at a dinner in Washington , `` with Guber Peters in mind '' that in the U.S. `` it is essential that corporations honor written contracts and do not induce breach of contracts by others .
But entertainment industry executives say that the new contract was signed after Guber Peters efforts to take over MGM failed and that Warner may argue in court that the producers ' willingness to sign a new long-term contract signaled the end of their search for a movie studio .
Warner , whose executives are the highest paid in the entertainment industry , also charges that Sony induced the two producers to breach their Warner contract by offering them `` the most lucrative and expensive package of financial inducements in the film industry , '' including $ 2.7 million each in annual salary , deferred compensation of $ 50 million , as much as 10 % of Columbia 's cash flow , and as much as 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value .
In their countersuit , Messrs. Guber and Peters say they seek $ 100 million in damages initially from Warner but may seek a higher amount later after determining the extent of damages .

I was profoundly moved by the incongruity of modern American life illustrated by your Sept. 20 page-one article `` Country Doctor : How a Physician Solved Riddle of Rare Disease in Children of Amish . ''
It requires doing the utmost within oneself to alleviate the illness and suffering of others .
Though Holmes Morton fulfills the `` requirements '' for being a true physician , our so-called sophisticated society and its medical system fail to appreciate the value of such a dedicated physician .
Otherwise , why is there not a rush of funds from medical circles or the related medical-support industry -- i.e. pharmaceutical companies , etc. -- or , most significantly , from all of us to support this doctor and his patients , to support a clinic to further the work of resolving human suffering ?
Dr. Morton 's success is not only a measure of the outstanding quality of his work , but also of the desperation the Amish must feel in the face of this horrendous disease .
How very refreshing to read about Dr. Morton after all the articles about the Boeskys , Millkens , Icahns , Trumps and such like ; about S&L officials and self-seeking officials and legislators , federal and state ; about corporate executives whose sole concern is the `` bottom line , '' all of which lead to the conclusion that as a society we have a woeful sense of values and give no thought to what `` life is all about .

Since the summer , soft-drink companies have been trying to extract themselves from a price-slashing war designed to steal market share from each other .
Because raw material costs have been escalating and because Coke and Pepsi have become bigger owners of bottling businesses , the companies have been raising soda pop prices in recent months .
That 's a fairly wide range , given the sheer size of the $ 42 billion soft-drink industry .
But analysts , and indeed , some of the soda companies , have had difficulty predicting consumer reaction to higher prices .
In August , Coca-Cola Enterprises , Coke 's largest bottling operation , said its 1989 earnings would fall as much as 37 % , partly because it misjudged consumer resistance to the new prices , which were 2 % to 3 % higher on average in July and August .

The reality to which Ms. Geva refers is the hoard of dance memorabilia currently on view at Eduard Nakhamkin Fine Arts here , under the title , `` 100 Years of Russian Ballet : 1830-1930 .
'' Consisting of roughly 400 items from the Leningrad State Museum of Theater and Music , the show offers tantalizing glimpses of a rich artistic achievement .
For Ms. Geva , an actress and author who began her career as a dancer during the early days of the Soviet state under her original name of Gevergeyeva , it offers something more : a sense of completion , the lifting of a curtain on the past .

In effect , he became the official curator of his former collection , which grew prodigiously and soon included several thousand costumes .
For Americans , the most interesting of the 400 items on display in New York include designs by the German-born Andrei Roller ( 1805-91 ) for the Russian productions of important early 19th-century Paris ballets .
No less illuminating are the designs from Petipa 's `` Sleeping Beauty '' ( 1890 ) , `` Nutcracker '' ( 1892 ) and `` Raymonda '' ( 1897 ) , which shed light on the role played by spectacle in the ballets of this great choreographer .
There also is much to be learned from the early stage photographs of Petipa 's work , which , though posed , extend our knowledge of its theatrical ambiance .
The mistress of Nicholas II until his engagement to Alexandra of Hesse-Darmstadt , she dominated the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg as much through her dancing as through her connections .
George Balanchine , to whom Ms. Geva was married as a teenager in 1923 and who began his career as an artistic revolutionary , also gets short shrift .
Less welcome is the random nature of the exhibition , which has no point to make beyond the indisputable fact that there are treasures in the Leningrad State Museum of Theater and Music .
While it 's an astonishing achievement for the Nakhamkin gallery to have organized the show in only three months , the time has surely come to present this kind of material in ways that reveal a context and a point of view .

Merger or not , the Zenith acquisition is a key part of Mr. Lorentz 's plan to grow Bull -- the world 's 11th biggest computer company last year -- into a profitable member of the top five or six computer makers .
Bull had a first-half net loss of 537 million francs ( $ 82.7 million ) on revenue of 14 billion francs ( $ 2.16 billion ) .

To do so , Bull is planting itself firmly in the U.S. , where , says Mr. Lorentz , a lot of the best people and research are .

Securities analysts are using terms like `` kitchen-sink syndrome '' and `` clearing the decks '' to describe the generally disappointing results that commercial banks are expected to report in the coming weeks .
A number of major banks have chosen to make huge additions to their loan-loss reserves in the third quarter , either for troubled loans to Latin American nations , soured real-estate loans in this country or bad loans to companies involved in leveraged buy-outs .
